		    There are two ways to look at this project, hence the ambiguity of the name.
				The first is the nighttime sky--the crystalline starways, the vast expanse of celestial bodies, the galaxies and nebulas painted so many eons ago that our ancestors once looked upon.
				It's somber, watching as every single hour, the world seems to shift--unbalanced.
				The second is the nighttime land--perhaps individual lights, dotted all throughout a darkened world. Alone.
				Some of them may be cities, like the clusters of color along the coastline. They may be roads, winding together occasionally, but never meeting more than once.
				They may even be independent streetlamps, that cast beams of light, serene and euphonically silent. They may be all of the above.
				Isn't it funny how we can alter the scope of this miniaturized world with the click of a mouse button?
